deploy via local git file
ensure the main file is named app.py
and you send of dependencies and requirements.txt on first push
in the folder:
>$git init //only done initially
>$git add <files here> //adds to staging area
>$git commit -m "message" //commits changes
>$git push --set-upstream <url.git> master
you will then be asked for credentials
